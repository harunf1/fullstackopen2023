    <h1>This is my long overdue HTML page</h1>
  <p>This is just some list practice</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Lorem</li>
  <li>ipsum</li>
  <li>more lorum</li>
  <li>more ipsum</li>
<li><a href="https://bitly.ws/3Vy7">A fun animation</a></li>
 </ul>

<form action = "/my-handling-form"  method="post">
  <ul>
<li>
<label for="name">name(just messing with forms)</label>
<input type="text" id = "name" name ="username"/>
</li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>theres a bunch of stuff that i missed out on, for exapmple doing the styling and doing the entire form list for other details but thats ok just wanted a quick refresher and write a little html most of this should be done by the frameworks anyway but its good to understand the fundmentals on the astructuce of a html page</p>  

  <p>This file was made with VIM (neovim to be precise)so it took me way too long lol, but i learnt i was able to practice a bunch of nvim shortcuts namely copying deleting lines saving without exiting and jumping around the file, still slower than using an Ide or normal text editor  but well see its kind of fun just using the keyboard and barely using the mouse.
I seriously need to psuh myself to use HJKL keys tho.
